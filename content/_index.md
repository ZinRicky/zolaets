Zolaets is a rough recreation of the flagship [Zonelets](https://zonelets.net/) style as a [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) theme.
The main objective of this theme is to make the transistion from Zonelets to Zola as seamless as possible (for the Web visitors).
This theme does *not* aim for 100% fidelity to the original neither on the coding nor on the final result.

The creation of this theme is partly due to the [32-bit Café Community Code Jam \#5](https://32bit.cafe/~xandra/events/codejam5/).
I don’t know very much about CSS and Web-dev in general, so I used the event as an excuse to check what I’m capable of in a rather short amount of time.
